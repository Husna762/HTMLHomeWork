	<h1>Is Java good for your computer?</h1> <br> 
<h3>At one time, Java was absolutely necessary if you wanted to be able to use your computer for, well, just about everything.</h3> <br> Today there is less need for it. A growing number of security experts recommend not installing Java if you don't already have it, and perhaps even getting rid of it if you do.
